招聘现状 如果不了解每个岗位之间有什么交流，都负责什么，你就不会知道哪种麻烦是你比较愿意承受的。比如运维就要24小时待机，比较累。还有一些岗位可以互相转。\n不同岗位：运维、设计、管理, etc. 软件研发的话，国家单位会好一点；设计单位加班比较严重，竞争也激烈一点。 管理路线有产品经理等等。大家现在可能的话可以去考一点PMP这种证，想走管理路线的话必须要有这个证，相当于是项目管理的一个资历。\n国企央企，待遇不同 虽然国企央企这样的单位比一般单位压力小一些，但是也要看公司和部门。他们的工作压力就是非常地大，周末一定要上班，而且工资特别地少。这种情况就不要以为国企央企就稳定，其实现在很多国企央企都开始自负盈亏了，大家基本都要签三四年的劳动合同，到期了也不一定续签。已经没有终身制了。\n不同学位，薪资不同 读了博士的话，可以读完博士，应届就有80万 他再工作五年也未必能有这个薪资水平\n终端相比互联网要整体稳定，但互联网可能有大钱赚 互联网产商的整体逻辑就是大面积撒网，创建项目，如果赚钱了就认真做 比如作业帮，一开始就是百度旗下的一个小组 有时候干了六个月就全部裁掉 也有抖音请大牛来做完一个音乐输入输出的项目，一做完就裁掉 但互联网/游戏确实回报丰厚，有时候会给 100个月的年终奖，也就是300-500w 原神也是一个例子\n很少有人能在这些岗位干到50岁左右，一定要在每个年龄段和阶段上进行突破 你要不停去精进你的专业和在业界的影响力，里面就涉及一个问题\n在任何地方往上走，都容易涉及管理经验\n比如阿里做到P7，没有一个管理的证书，就上不去了。 他现在是2.5w/月，下次调薪就会出现岗位职级，换公司也是一样的。\n答疑 跨专业申研 理科申请人文专业比较简单，但是要注意：\n语言成绩。去澳洲的话可以免英语成绩，但是别的国家的人文专业一般要雅思7分以上。 就业方向和薪资待遇是否符合自己预期。 外资/外国/跨国公司 可以去，推荐去。\nGoogle/Intel/Microsoft这类的公司都很卷，需要刷Leetcode高阶题500-800道 要刷的话要注意平衡课业和刷题 外国的公司可能存在对华人的歧视问题，而且政策和心理导致他们都会优先考虑本国的员工 游戏公司 可以去，可能会比较好玩，但是不见得轻松。\n国内的大厂进去都不会轻松，都得端茶送水买甜甜圈。 可以看看B站上面 -LK- 等人分享的拳头公司实习一日经历。\n凡是这种环境高手都很多，高手多的地方你自己就要看看自己。\n游戏行业在走下坡路。 世界上信息产业都不太景气，EA就在裁员。\n申请港前三需要科研经历 可以花钱买科研项目，也可以自己找人脉，也可以自学。\n实习如何选择 和以后的工作需要高度契合。 大厂有转正机会一定要留下来，不然以后秋招春招进去难度会陡升。\n研究生院校QS排名重要吗 有时候HR在不熟悉的专业领域会把简历交给你的专业领域的专家，他们会优先考虑学校这个专业的能力，越是大厂越会如此。\n如果有落户目标的同学，可以多看看不同城市的人才引进政策，研究一下，但大多几乎都是要硕士起步的，QS200以内的\n学长赠言 机遇也会很多，接收的知识信息也会更为丰富。 对自己来说就是经历嘛。怎么迅速增长经历，不一定非要自己去体验，听专业的人讲，或者体验过的人讲和解读，也算我们自己的经历。单凭自学已经很难追上社会的发展了。复合型人才的需求越来越多，大家不得不被卷。\n","date":"2024-05-26T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://stoic42.github.io/p/%E6%AF%95%E4%B8%9A%E7%94%9F%E7%BB%8F%E9%AA%8C%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB%E4%BC%9A/","title":"毕业生经验分享会"},{"content":"After a day of searching and following the steps from the guides, I have almost set up my personal blog using Hugo and Github Page.\nI benefited hugely from this guide from Leehow.\nI got lost a few times, but I managed to get back on track by referring to this guide by 小绵尾巴 which is for Mac users.\nI met a few problems with git push and pull, in order to solve which I consulted the answers: fatal: unable to access \u0026rsquo;
